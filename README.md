## What is this
Using the Apple Music API, this tool will return a playlist of songs which spell out any given string (to the best of its ability).

# Memes
It's a moderately common meme on the internet that person A sends a playlist to person B in which there is some subtle message given by the first word for all the names
of the songs. This will automate the creation! (Because I don't have a dev account, it will just give the songs :(  )
